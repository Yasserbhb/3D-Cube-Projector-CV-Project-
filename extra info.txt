TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

To test a new video (test_video_large.mp4) that we uploaded in drive, follow these steps. Alternatively, you can run the code directly to test test_video_small.mp4 again.

1-Prepare the New Video
Location: Ensure that test_video_large.mp4 is placed in the local folder alongside the other scripts.

2-Update the Input File in main.py
File to Edit: main.py
video_path = "test_video_large.mp4"  # Line 28


3-Execute the Script main.py

4-Expected Output:
An updated output.mp4 will be generated after processing and it will appear in the folder.
        Execution Time:
            Approximately 15 seconds for 100 frames of test_video_small.mp4.
            Approximately 55 seconds for 360 frames of test_video_large.mp4.





Method Tierces

When you run the script main_tierces.py, it:

1. Uses test1.mp4 to detect checkerboard corners and automatically compute the camera intrinsic matrix K.

2. Generates an output video using the same 3D projection method, saving the result as output_tierces.mp4.

PS!!!!! : If you use the test video large.mp4 downloaded by the above lien, please consider to update the input file in main_tierces.py

File to Edit: main tierces.py
video_path = "test_video_large.mp4"  # Line 85


Please ensure all files are in the same folder before running the script. This demonstrates how the automatic calibration (Method Tierces) can estimate K directly from a video and apply the same overlay procedure as the manual approach.
